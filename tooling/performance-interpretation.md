These fixed-seed `stepping` workloads measure transition and observation overhead.
They do not establish convergence, mixing, effective sample size, or scientific efficiency.
Ratios are baseline time divided by current time; values above one mean lower current time.
Marginal timing bounds do not establish a paired ratio interval or statistical significance.

Review common names against the lifecycle contracts in `docs/BENCHMARKING.md`, especially
when harness fingerprints differ. Added and removed names are coverage changes.
Local measurements require matching known host identities. Release-asset comparisons
need separate hardware and workload review; GitHub runners can change between releases.
Unknown historical provenance stays unknown. Legacy fingerprints retain their original
meaning in the evidence's `legacy.*` context and are not shared-format fingerprints.
